# Radiotray-py
Lets you listen to your favorite radio stations, easily accessible from the tray.  
Heavily inspired by the Linux app [Radiotray-NG](https://github.com/ebruck/radiotray-ng), this Python based app works on Mac, Windows and Linux.  
I decided to write my own variant of the traditional Radiotray app when I started using Mac, where there were no app quite like it.  

# Features and functionality 
Radiotray-py features a robust bookmark editor, and stores the radio stations in bookmarks.json.  
On Windows, Radiotray-py uses wmplayer.exe as its audio backend. On Mac, it uses AFPlay. And on Linux, BSD and others, it uses MPV.
